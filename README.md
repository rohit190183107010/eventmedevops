# EventMe DevOps Challenge


## Instructions:

- Please use your GCP Account to provision resources

- Use Pulumi and typescript to create or complete the assignment

- Use best practices for Infra as code and security 


## The assignment

- The goal is to setup a GKE cluster, deploy an app and complete the ingress

- For most of the execerise you have a base template to start with or to fix existing code.

- Please navigate to cluster, app, and ingress in that order to complete the excerise

## What do we expect?

We're looking to understand you familiarity with our core infra technologies: GCP, K8s and Pulumi (typescript). We have extracted this code from our own infra codebase, so if you like this challenge you'll love working with us!

The way we will evaluate your submission is by:
 1) Running `pulumi up` and waiting for all the resources to be created
 2) Hitting the app root and expecting to see a "Hello world"

If the submission does both of the above, we'll surely call you for the next steps. If it doesn't, we'll evaluate the solution and decide on a case by case basis.

Best of luck!
